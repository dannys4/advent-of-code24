# Advent of Code 24
## Daniel Sharp
Here is my codebase for the advent of code, 2024.

## Usage:
Put your input as `data/dayX.txt` where `X` is the day number. Then run `cargo run` in the root directory of this project. To change which days are run, change the `main` function in `src/main.rs` so that `&dayX::fcn` is paired with `false` for each day `X` you don't want to run.
